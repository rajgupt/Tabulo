Tabulo is an open source toolkit for **computer vision**. Currently, we support table detection, but we are aiming for much more. It is built in Python, using [Luminoth](https://github.com/tryolabs/luminoth), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Sonnet](https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet).

## 1. Installation Instructions
Tabulo currently supports Python 2.7 and 3.4â€“3.6. 
First, clone the repo on your machine and then install with `pip`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/interviewBubble/Tabulo.git
cd tabulo
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Check that the installation worked

Simply run `tabulo --help`.

## 2. Avaiable API's
* `localhost:5000/api/fasterrcnn/predict/`   - To detect table in the image
* `localhost:5000/api/fasterrcnn/extract/`   - Extract table content from detected tables

## 3. Working with pretrained Models:
* DOWNLOAD pretrained model from [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aUh9RfGn2XGgG2EtpKFh7P6PmcC3Q48z?usp=sharing)
* Unzip and Copy downloaded luminoth folder inside ```luminoth/utils/pretrained_models``` folder
* Hit this command to list all check points: ```tabulo checkpoint list```
* You will get output like this:
![Checkpoints](https://github.com/interviewBubble/Tabulo/raw/master/docs/images/Checkpoints.png)
* Now run server using this command: ```tabulo server web --checkpoint 6aac7a1e8a8e```

## 5. Runnning Tabulo As Service:

### 5.1 Using Curl command
```Curl command to detect tabel
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:5000/api/fasterrcnn/predict/ \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: 70478bd2-e1e8-442f-b0bf-ea5ecf7bf4d8' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW' \
  -F image=@/path/to/image/page_8-min.jpg
``` 
### 5.2 With PostMan

## 6. Supported models

Currently, we support the following models:

* **Object Detection**
  * [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)
  * [SSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325)

We also provide **pre-trained checkpoints** for the above models trained on popular datasets such as [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/) and [Pascal](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/).

## 7. Usage

There is one main command line interface which you can use with the `tabulo` command. Whenever you are confused on how you are supposed to do something just type:

`tabulo --help` or `tabulo <subcommand> --help`

and a list of available options with descriptions will show up.

## 8. Working with datasets

 [DataSet to train your custom model](https://github.com/interviewBubble/Table-Detection-using-Deep-Learning/tree/master/data).

## 9. Training

See [Training your own model](https://github.com/interviewBubble/Table-Detection-using-Deep-Learning) to learn how to train locally or in Google Cloud.

## 10. LICENSE
Released under the [BSD 3-Clause](LICENSE).
